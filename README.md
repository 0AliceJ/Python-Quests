## Quest 1: quest1.py

A practice coding project that re-introduces me to python. The goal is to decrypt a message encoded using the Caesar cypher. After trial and error, the code sifts each character in the message and reassigns the character and inputs it into a new string to output.

## Quest 2: tictactoe.py

A command-line-interface two player tic-tac-toe game, played with X and Y. 

## Quest 2.5: IN PROGRESS

A rework of the CLI tic-tac-toe game above. Using feedback received on the previous version, the tic-tac-toe game is improved to be more user-friendly by removing the use of global variables and clearing the cluttered command line.
